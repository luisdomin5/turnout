Since you mailed your absentee ballot request form a week or two ago, now is
a good time to verify that it was received and your absentee ballot is en route:
<br><br>

<strong><a href="{{ state_info.external_tool_absentee_ballot_tracker }}">Track your absentee ballot</a></strong>

Since you mailed your absentee ballot request form a week or two ago,
now is a good time to verify that it was received, and find out when
your absentee ballot will be mailed to you.

Unlike most states, {{ ballot_request.state }} does not have an online
tool to track your absentee ballot.  However, you can e-mail or call
your Local Election Office to check whether your ballot request has
been received (and perhaps mention how helpful an online tool would
be):<br><br>
